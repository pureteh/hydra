Given some datum hash, the API can return, if it exists, the pre-image of that hash digest. On the other end, we have a light-wallet provider with full Cardano smart-contract support and extra care for user experience and security. Part of the transaction workflow of the wallet consists of looking up datums and scripts included in transactions it sees, coming from various DApps its users interact with. Doing so, it can better show how a specific transaction will affect a contract and the data it carries.

In the final infrastructure, the light-wallet backend server is connected to the service provider with a long-running head.
