For Cardano, this is reflected in the fact that blocks are created on average each 20 seconds, in this time, block creation, propagation, and validation happens. These limitations ultimately mean that state, the information that describes the system, can only change in discrete steps of this duration. Besides, given peak hours on the blockchain when there is a transaction queue, the time required to settle and confirm a transaction might also be higher, further increasing the effective settlement time.

Here, the performance of the system is increased by adding more instances of the same system alongside each other. Practically, this means that besides the main chain, one or multiple side chains are spun up that do the same thing, each "x" seconds all instances create a block. Unlike vertical scaling, horizontal scaling does not know a limit, there can be many side chains that are connected to the layer one. A downside to this way of scaling is that this abstract notion of "state" is split up into multiple pieces.

When the channel closes, each party has a chance to return their last perceived state. In case of dispute, the main chain can always verify the latest snapshot, which contains all signatures of the participants and a timestamp.
